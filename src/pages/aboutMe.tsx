              I am a developer from South Korea, who immigrated to Canada in 2012. I am currently attending the University of Waterloo, where my expected year of graudation is 2028. In the the midst of 2022, I had to put my education on hold for a while to complete my mandatory military service back in South Korea. In the military, I learned many useful soft skills such as communication, teamwork, adaptability, and integrity. Out of all of these skills, I believe adaptability was one that shone the most in my time of service. It was a new environment, full of new and different people, tasked with completing missions that were unfamilitar to me. However, despite the new environment that I was put in, I was able to quickly adapt and meet the expectations that my seniors and commanding officers had for me.
